# 🔐 EFS Explorer

**EFS Explorer** (Encrypted File System Explorer) is a browser-based secure file manager that allows you to **encrypt, store, and manage files directly in your browser**.  
All files are protected using **AES-GCM encryption** with a password-derived key. Nothing leaves your device — everything is handled locally using the Web Crypto API and IndexedDB.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Password-based security**
  - Files are encrypted with AES-GCM.
  - Keys are derived using PBKDF2 with random salt + high iteration count.
  - Password is never stored — you must re-enter it to unlock files.

- **Secure file storage**
  - Files are stored in browser’s IndexedDB.
  - Only ciphertext, salt, IV, and metadata are stored.
  - Even if someone steals the DB, contents remain encrypted.

- **Drag & drop upload**
  - Intuitive drag-and-drop zone with pulsing glow animation.
  - File input button as fallback.

- **File explorer**
  - Lists all stored encrypted files after unlocking.
  - Allows downloading (decrypted) or deleting files.

- **Integrity checking**
  - SHA-256 hash ensures decrypted file matches the original.

- **Reset environment**
  - Reset button wipes all stored files and clears session.
  - 5-second delayed confirmation (Yes/No) to prevent accidents.

- **UI/UX**
  - Clean and lightweight design (HTML + CSS).
  - Smooth animations for drag-over states.
  - Styled confirmation dialogs and buttons.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a modern browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
3. Set a password to unlock the environment.
4. Drag and drop files to encrypt and store them.
5. To retrieve files:
   - Enter the same password.
   - Select files to download (decrypted).
6. Use **Reset** to wipe everything (irreversible).

## ⚠️ Security Notes

- Files are encrypted locally with **AES-GCM**.  
- Passwords are never stored. If forgotten, files **cannot** be recovered.  
- Reset permanently deletes all encrypted data.  
- Browser extensions or keyloggers may compromise security.  
- For maximum security, use strong passwords.

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Folder support (virtual directories in IndexedDB).  
- Multi-user / role-based access.  
- Cloud sync of encrypted blobs.  
- Session auto-lock after inactivity.  
- File preview without full download.
